# Project Spotlight

## Project Description:
Embarking on a transformative journey in AWS! Leveraging the power of Lambda functions, SNS, S3, and CloudWatch Event Bridge, we've crafted an automated solution.

### Automation Galore
**Bash Script Magic:**
- Created three dynamic bash scripts: one for seamless CloudFormation template creation, another for hassle-free deletion, and the last for swift updates. ⚙️✅🗑️

**Python Prowess:**
- Engineered a Python script to effortlessly zip the Lambda function, prepping it for deployment in the cloud. 🐍📦🚀

**Sed Script Symphony:**
- Orchestrated a bash script to elegantly replace the SNS topic ARN within the Lambda function script, ensuring seamless integration. 🔄🎵

## Mission
Keep a vigilant eye on Lambda functions. When a failure status is detected, trigger an email notification via SNS. All orchestrated by CloudWatch, initiating the process every 3 minutes. ⏰


## Crafted with Precision:
- **AWS CloudFormation:** The architect's tool of choice, sculpting our infrastructure with finesse. 💡

Result: A seamlessly integrated system, keeping operations streamlined and stakeholders informed! 📧📊
